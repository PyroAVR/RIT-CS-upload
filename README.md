# RIT-CS-upload-script
A handy tool in Python to package files for uploading as a zipfile.  Developed for use in RIT CS classes.


# How to use this program
## Windows ##
*stop - use Linux or macOS please, you'll thank me when you get to Mechanics.*

Place this file in whatever directory you make your CS projects in.  If you're using PyCharm, you will likely run into difficulties, as Python3 is unlikely to be on your PATH.  If it is not, come ask me and I will help you.
Assuming that Python3 is on your path, you have two options. Run this program with:
```batch
makeCSupload.py
```
If that does not work, WinDOS may not be set up to run .py files using Python3.  Try the following instead:
```batch
python3 makeCSupload.py
```

## macOS ##

Python is already on your system, but the question is whether it is Python3 or Python2.  It is most likely Python2, and if you are using PyCharm, you will likely run into the same issue as the Windows users.  I'm still working on this.
Assuming that you are a sensible person and you do not use PyCharm, you can run it from the command line as follows:

```bash
./makeCSupload.py
```
Or, if you run into trouble:

```bash
python3 makeCSupload.py
```

## Linux ##
Python is already on your system, but the question is whether it is Python3 or Python2.  If you've already been working in Linux for this course, you definitely have Python3. Simply type:
```bash
./makeCSupload.py
```
from your favorite terminal emulator.
